## Starburst Data

> How can we improve, through development and design, a documentation website?

During the Summer of 2022, I held the position of Web Development and Design Intern at Starburst.
My responsibilities included:

- Collaborating between technical writers and the UX designers
- Improve the usability and design aspects of documentation sites (Starburst and Trino)
- Build data driven pages
- Create iconography

### Problems and Challenges

The current Starburst Documentation can be broken down into Starburst Universe and Starburst Docs. Both websites require an update that brings usability to the forefront. Overall, the goal was to unify both Universe and Docs while improving UX. Below are screenshots of the sites at the start of my internship:

#### Unifying the Headers

One of the first tasks I was given was to unify the headers of Universe and Docs. Considering that these two sites were under the same URL, there were criticisms about the lack of seamless navigation. Based on the UX's teams Figma wireframes, I created a pixel perfect implementation of the new header.

#### Landing Pages

Another goal was to condense the information on the landing pages in one banner. After creating my own data driven implementation, I reached out for feedback from the UX team. Based on several deign thinking questions, I made revisions until both the designers and developers were satisfied.

A major feature of discussion was how to define good primary and secondary CTA buttons. We settled on a teal and transparent design.

#### Video Pages

A large task that I completed was reworking the entirety of the Video Page Template. My goal was to condense the information and provide logic to display data. To do this, I used a Javascript implementation on the .md and .html files.

#### Technical Iconography

On the design side, I worked on an Icon Library for the documentation team. A reference sheet was created depicting the icon and standards for architectural diagrams. Using Figma, I created the icon library in their brand colors. These icons were later used in various diagrams I also helped create below.

### Challenges and Conclusions
Overall, I enjoyed my time at Starburst and working within the Documentation team. I was looking for an internship where my work would be an impactful contribution for the company itself. As the Web Development and Design Intern, I was able to contribute in both the design and technical aspects of the project.

A few challenges I faced was figuring out how to work in a remote capacity (while balancing my role as a student) and understanding industry practices and standards. Although there were few mistakes, I learned, improved, and sought feedback.

As a tech startup, I jumped right into my tasks at the beginning of the internship. Although fast-paced at first, I quickly found my pace and workflow. After this internship, I developed a solid idea of what I seek in my future tech career.
